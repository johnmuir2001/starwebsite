        <h2>Outcome 3 (Review)</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>I think I was quite efficient when making my website. I made fast progress, if I didnt know how to do something I looked it up
            and if I still didnt know how to do something I asked for help. I think the only area I could have been more efficient on is the 
            planning stage. This is because I didnt really plan it because my ideas changed as we went on.</p>
             <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
             <p>I could have planned more or written all of the content early on so that once I started making the website I didnt have to stop
                 to write one of the outcomes. I could have also put more thought on the looks early on so that I did'nt spend a lot of time trying
                 something, not liking how it looks, deleting it and trying something else because I did this a few times. Another big problem was the way I 
                 organised my files. I cpoied one folder with the same html file and css file for each page, not realising how complicated and unnecessary
                 that was. This is because all of the pages looked the same and I ended up linking all html files to the same css file. If I did it again 
                 I would have planned for this and organised the files better so that the more there are the simpler it is to make changes, rather than change
                 6 css files to the same thing.
             </p>
                  <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
                  <p>I think I would make more use of trello early on in the project. This is so it doesnt get as complicated with files later on, and I can 
                    just link pages I want to look the same to one css file. I would also use some pages, slides or other documents to quickly get a rough colour
                    palette as its quicker than deciding in css. I could also use github more because there were times I wanted to carry on working but I didnt 
                    have the computer but could have carried on if it was on github.
                  </p>
                        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
                        <p>Testing digital solutions is quite simple. This is due to the live server updates, so I can moniter changes made as I made them. Towards the 
                          end of the project I also changed the size of the websites window. This allowed me to see how the website changed and adapted to the changes. In my 
                          case it changed a lot and I had to re-write some of the css files to make it more inclusive. Then you could test it out on different people to
                          see if they can use it and if they like it. If you have any specific target markets they should be used to test the solution. It should be 
                          tested in different browsers to see if it translates. This last stage of testing can be an iterative process to make sure it works on all areas
                          you want it to work on.
