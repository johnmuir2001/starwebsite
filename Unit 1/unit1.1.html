        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>IT can speed up the time it takes new products to reach the market. Companies can write product 
            requirement documents by gathering market intelligence from proprietary databases, customers and sales 
            representatives. CAD & CAM software speed up, and reduce the cost of the design and manufacture of 
            products. Collaborative technologies allow global teams to work on different components of a product 
            simultaneously. The long-term cost savings are usually worth the IT investment. IT-based productivity 
            solutions have allowed companies to save on the costs while maintaining and improving product quality 
            and customer service. IT is at the core of operating models which is essential for globalisation, 
            such as telecommuting and outsourcing. A company can outsource most of its noncore functions, such 
            as human resources and finances, to offshore companies and use network technologies to stay in contact
             with its overseas employees, customers and suppliers.<br>References:<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/six-important-business-objectives-information-technology-25220.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>,

             <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
                    successfully </h3>
             <p>There are lots of methodologies behind digital project management but almost all digital projects 
                 will go through the same basic 5-step method: Scoping, Planning, Development, Testing & Deployment, 
                 Maintenance. There are also skills required that can be gained through basic work experience and 
                 collaboration. Skills such as time management, resource management, project communication management, 
                 planning, organising, and delegating can be developed in almost any role. Some skills you might 
                 need are: Collaboration, strong communication skills, problem solver, attention to detail, strong
                  organisational skills etc. There are lots of digital project management tools available. Software 
                  as a service allow projects to get organised, allows for group communication, share files and assign 
                  tasks. Some popular tools include: agile tools, planning software, data analytics solutions, and 
                  collaboration platforms. More specifically: G suite, Airtable, Slack, and Trello are all helpful 
                  resources to successfully complete a digital project.

                  <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
                  <p>To plan my website I will use Trello. This is a good tool to use as I find the KanBan 
                      method useful to breakup and visualise the project. It will also help keep me on top of 
                      the project so I am never thinking what to do next but can look. Back at the board to 
                      choose the next step. I will break up the tasks into 4 main sections: Prepare, 
                      Landscape, Aesthetics, and Navigation. Prepare is for research and identifying appropriate
                      tone and my goals. Landscape is for thinking through how the website should function 
                      and what features it needs. Aesthetics is they it looks, feels and operates. Navigation 
                      is the overall user experience.<br>References:<a href="https://trello.com/b/VT9e5QNT/website-project" target="_blank">Trello board</a>,

                        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
                        <p>Without a risk assessment of digital projects it is highly likely that they could 
                            go wrong. One of the biggest risks is failing to plan. By investing time upfront 
                            to address risks, you’ll be better prepared to turn unexpected events into new 
                            opportunities, instead putting out fires. Estimating time is important if there 
                            is a deadline. It is better to overestimate and make a functioning website than 
                            to underestimate and rush it to a lower quality. Some risks are unavoidable which 
                            can slow down productivity, this can be from technologies being discontinued to 
                            changes in government policy. A budget cut is one of the hardest risks to face 
                            as you still have to satisfy the client but have limited resources. Today’s market 
                            is competitive as ever. This means clients may sometimes change their vision of 
                            how the product or certain features on the website should look like. Even though 
                            it’s hard to be prepared for change of requirements, it’s one of the things that 
                            need to considered or it could result in a delayed launch and unhappy clients.

                            <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
                            <p>Selecting the right IT systems and software is crucial for the rest of the 
                                project because it needs to do what you need it to do. To start you need to 
                                know your objective. You cannot be successful in searching for software unless 
                                you know what you're looking for. Then you should create a comprehensive list 
                                of requirements for the system, which is where the research is important. 
                                Then you can start searching for applications that fulfil your needs. This 
                                should be a long list so that no software is overlooked. Then you start 
                                excluding some of the options that don’t compare as well as others. This 
                                short list may be down to 5 or 10 different systems. Next you can start 
                                trialling your selected software whilst constantly assessing the software 
                                against your criteria. After that you should have an idea of which system 
                                is the best for what you need doing. The final stage is pricing up not just 
                                the software cost but implementation time, support levels, and service 
                                availability.

                                <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
                                        achieve your outcomes</h3>
                                <p>Trello is a vital tool in order to plan. It is effectively a helpful to do 
                                    list due to the to do, doing, and done layout of it. I found this extremely 
                                    useful as if I am struggling of thinking what to do next so I can go to the 
                                    Trello board and see what is next on the list. This streamlines the project 
                                    as there is as little thinking time done later in the project, providing 
                                    sufficient planning was done at the start of the project. Github is also 
                                    very useful as it means I can work on the project form anywhere which means 
                                    progress stops when I leave one computer. This also means I can share it with 
                                    other people to show or to get help with. Version control allows me to save my 
                                    work to Github and manage my progress. This also means I can use previous saves 
                                    if I make. Big mistake that requires me to go back.

                                    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
                                    <p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) puts the consumer in the drivers seat 
                                        and it is the companies responsibility to comply with its regulation or they 
                                        could face serious fines. If the digital project works with personal data, a 
                                        special job should be created with the sole purpose of making sure they are in 
                                        compliance with GDPR. Overall this means companies have to be much more careful 
                                        when working around marketing and sales activities. This means making sure that 
                                        whenever your website is asking for personal data, it’s also clearly asking 
                                        for consent.
