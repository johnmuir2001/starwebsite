                   <h1>About Me</h1>
               <h2>Before Code Nation</h2>
               <p>After finishing my A-Levels in Maths, Business, and Design & Technology: Product Design. I didnâ€™t 
                   know what I wanted to do so I started doing what I enjoyed in school which was Design & Technology. 
                   This lead to me setting up a workshop where I could focus on improving my woodworking skills. I enjoy 
                   the iterative process of researching, designing, and making of the product. So far I have mainly been 
                   making furniture or little projects as gifts for family. This is so I can build up confidence to try 
                   and sell products in the future. </p>

               <h2>Why Code Nation?</h2>
               <p>I then thought about expanding my skills to a different area which is where I thought about coding. 
                   Upon further research I found Code Nation and signed up for a 3-week develop course in software 
                   development. I am really enjoying using the skills we learn to make apps and websites and will 
                   definitely like to carry on coding after the course.
