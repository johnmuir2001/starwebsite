            <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
            <p>I am gonig for a clean minimalist design. The main page will just have just "John's Website" on it with a background image and animation.
              Then there is an about me page which has a section called "before code nation" which is about my past, then a "why code nation?" section which talks about
              how I got intersted in learning to code. The next tab on the nav bar is Unit 1 which is a dropdown menu that involves Outcome 1-3 each page 
              just goes over the resarch and specification points from each outcome. Then the last tab is Unit 2 which goes over the specification requiremnets
              for unit 2 outcome 1. All of the pages have a centered layout with the unit at the top, then the outcome, then the point title and the information in a box underneath.
              There is also an Easter egg on the home page that takes you through a maze to find the end.

            <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
            <p>Copyright is the protection of images. This means that if the person who creates an image copyrights it they are protected. For people to use these images they need to ask permission form the original owner and possibly have to pay to use the image. If they donâ€™t ask permission then, there could be repercussions in the form of fines. Intellectual property laws as well as copyright can restrict what people are able to publish on their websites. If you want to use intellectual property, then you should have a reference to the original source and to be safe, get permission from the writer of the information. Trademark is when an image, word, slogan is protected, these are a bit more off limits to use as they are mostly unique to the product or brand. Defamation refers to a false statement made about someone or some organisation that is damaging to their reputation. The laws behind it are complicated but web page developers must be careful to avoid defaming someone in their pages to protect themselves as much as possible.

                 <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
                 <p>Websites should be accessible as possible so that no one is left out. This could mean adapting your website to account for these disabilities: Auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. This could mean adding features that will read the text on a page or read the button that the mouse is over so that blind or semi blind people can use and gather information from the website. People with colour blindness may have their own colour sheet or have changed the settings on the computer to make the user experience better for them. This can be helped by making sure text which contrasts with the background. Deaf people can struggle if there is visual content and there is a lack of captions. There are many small details that can be changed to make life easier for these people. People with physical disabilities may have difficulty using a keyboard, or find it difficult to use a mouse, and will need to rely on the keyboard for Web browsing. Some people will use adaptive technology with their computer to access the Web. Less severe disabilities could make the task of highlighting, manipulating pull-down boxes or mouse clicks difficult.

                      <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
                      <p>Filetypes for websites include:<br>
                        .HTML (HyperText Markup Language file) most pages you create for a website will be HTML files<br>
                        .CSS (Cascading StyleSheet) these that take care of how their websites look<br>
                        .GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) the most common image format on the internet<br>
                        .PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms and still look the same<br>
                        .ZIP zipped files are groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit<br>
                        .TXT the most basic file, just contains text
