        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
        <p>Visual Studio Code has been very helpful in that it's interface is very easy to understand
            and get use to quickly. The live server sped up the process a lot as I could see any changes that I made as soon as I made them.
        This and the auto save feature has made working with VScode a very pleasant experience. I have not used my Trello board as much because 
    I didnt feel I needed to. If I had a new idea or plan I could just go onto it straight away and didnt feel the need to plan out what I was doing when it came to me. </p>
             <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate  </h3>
             <p>I think the choice of VScode to make the website was a good one because it clearly seperates the css files and the html files into a good user experience. It also files
                 the documents in a clear to understand way. I would recommend using VScode to any first time website developers given my experience so far. Trello would be good 
                if there were a lot of different links, pages, and information to go on a website and was probably appropriate to use for this project.
            I on the other hand did not utilise this tool in the project. </p>
                  <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
                  <p>I am very happy with my website. I really like the details I managed to put in, in just a few days. I enjoyed doing the star animation
                      and the shooting stars. I think it looks good and is intuitive whilst displaying all relevant information. I want to add more features like
                      a parallax effect on the background stars. As well as changing the nav bar so that instead of a button for each outcome there is a button called Unit 1 with 
                      a dropdown tab that has the outcomes on it.</p>
                        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
                        <p> I think I would try and change the animations in the future. I wanted to place the stars and shooting stars 
                                randomly but couldnt figure out a pure css method to do this. I am sure if I had more time I could fully understand these animations. Overall
                            I would like to add different animations, not just in the background but also in the buttons on the nav bar so they do more than just change colour
                         when the cursor hovers over it.</p>
                            <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
                            <p>I have checked all of the outcomes and they match the requirements specified.</p>
